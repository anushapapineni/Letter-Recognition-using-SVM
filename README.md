# Hand written-Recognition-using-SVM
The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image. 

This is a classification model with output of 10 classes.
The accuracy of the model when trained with RBF Kernel is higer than the accuracy with Linear kernel. 

Conclusion:
Hyperparameter tuning with SVM algorithm took lot of time on my machine. This is where high compute CPUs/GPUs come into picture
